# Text Encryptor 🔐
[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-blue)](/README.md)

## Descripción 📋
This project is part of a **challenge** focused on applying **programming logic** concepts using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal is to develop a **text encryptor** that allows users to transform messages using a basic encryption algorithm, applying data manipulation skills.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML5:** Structure of the web content  
- **CSS3:** Styles and responsive design  
- **JavaScript:** Logic and DOM manipulation 

---

## Features </>

- Encrypt a text input based on a defined logic  
- Decrypt the encrypted text to retrieve the original  
- Validations to prevent invalid inputs  
- User-friendly web interface 
- Clear the input to write a new one

---

## How the Encryptor Works 📖

1. **Input Text**: The user inputs a message in the text field.
2. **Encrypt**: The message is transformed using a predefined algorithm.
3. **Decrypt**: Allows reversing the message back to its original state.
4. **Copy**: Option to copy the encrypted/decrypted result.
5. **Clear**: Removes the input to write a new one

## Encryption Logic 🔑

The encryption follows these rules:
- The letter **"e"** is converted to **"enter"**
- The letter **"i"** is converted to **"imes"**
- The letter **"a"** is converted to **"ai"**
- The letter **"o"** is converted to **"ober"**
- The letter **"u"** is converted to **"ufat"**

For example, the word **"hello"** is encrypted as **"henterllober"**.

## Project Purpose 🌱
This challenge puts into practice knowledge acquired in Alura ONE's programming logic courses while allowing experimentation with text manipulation. It also helps develop fundamental skills in JavaScript and fosters a logical mindset for solving future problems.

---

## Key Learnings 🧠
- Manipulating text strings in JavaScript.
- Implementing basic algorithms.
- Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a complete project.
- Developing skills in programming logic.
